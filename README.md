# Social data analysis 2017

The current repository was created for the Social data analysis and visualazitaion course offered by DTU. With the help of d3.js visualazation tool.

# One scatter plot and two datasets

The goal of the first part of our task was to visualize San Francisco's crime data from 2003 and 2015 reagarding the areas and the type of crime occured. Each circle corresponds to a specific crime category while the radious of the circle is proportional to the number of incidents. Use the toolgle button to switch between 2003-2015.
  
# Visualizing geodata

On the next step we explore K-means clustering. The overall idea is that each value of K has an associated view, where each of the K centroids is shown as a large colored dot, and all GPS points belonging to that centroid are colored accordingly. With the assigned buttons you can toggle among the K values.

# Tools Needed
In the repo the ipython notebook where the data manipulation took place as well as the scripts used for the final page could be found.
